# VideoSync

Small project for watching videos together online I started to familiarize myself with the Elixir language and the Phoenix framework, as well as deplying on fly.io.

## Usage
As with any Phoenix project the usage is as follows:
  * Run `mix setup` to install and setup dependencies
  * Start Phoenix endpoint with `mix phx.server` or inside IEx with `iex -S mix phx.server`

Now you can visit [`localhost:4000`](http://localhost:4000) from your browser.
